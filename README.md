🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation Analysis

A Data Science and Machine Learning project that performs customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques. Customer segmentation helps businesses divide customers into meaningful groups based on features like age, gender, annual income, and spending score. This allows shopping malls and retailers to design targeted marketing strategies, personalized offers, and loyalty programs.

🚀 Features

✅ Groups customers into distinct clusters using K-Means and other clustering algorithms

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understand spending patterns, age distribution, and income groups

🔍 Optimal Cluster Selection – Uses Elbow Method & Silhouette Score

📈 Visualization – 2D and 3D scatter plots of customer clusters

🧩 Actionable Insights – Helps in targeted marketing and business strategy

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Core programming language

Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing & manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, evaluation metrics

Jupyter Notebook – Development & experimentation environment

⚙️ Workflow

Load and preprocess dataset (CustomerID, Gender, Age, Income, Spending Score)

Perform EDA to explore customer behavior

Apply K-Means clustering (and other algorithms for comparison)

🎯 Applications

Targeted marketing campaigns

Customer loyalty programs

Product placement strategies

Personalized recommendations

📌 Future Enhancements

Advanced clustering with DBSCAN / Gaussian Mixture Models

Deployment as a web app for interactive customer analysis

Integration with real-time POS data
